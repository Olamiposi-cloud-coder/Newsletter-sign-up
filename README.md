## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- I learnt more about the JavaScript syntax and how to write Js by sticking with the DRY principle.
- I also learnt how to Manipulate CSS Sytle using JavaScript

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Useful resources

- [MDN resource 1](https://www.mdn.com) - This helped me with my JavaScript. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [w3schools resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand some css styling. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
